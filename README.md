# musicbot
A music bot for discord, mostly for test purposes and learning node/discord.js


Thanks to this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOnp3G4h7cg for helping out with this bot.

This will require a settings.json file to be made and put into the source folder. It will follow this format. 
{
  "yt_api_key": "YOUR YOUTUBE API KEY",
  "discord_token": "YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN",
  "bot_controller": "YOUR OWN ID",
  "prefix": "-"
}
